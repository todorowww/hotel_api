# Hotel API

This is just a demo project, to be used with the [QA tester](https://www.qa.rs/kursevi/kurs-qa-tester) course.

It is free to use, it may be buggy (purposefully, and accidentally), and it may be incomplete. Future improvements are
planned, but not guaranteed.

## Requirements
You need to be able to run Laravel 8, and you need MyQL for data storage.
I recommend latest PHP and MySQL. And a working web server, like Apache or Nginx.

## Installation
Clone the repository adn run all the necessary installs, like composer and npm.
Adn dont forget to migrate and seed the data.

## Plans
I plan to bump Laravel to at least 10, maybe 11.
Also, I plan to dockerize the project completely, and to automate all the installation
steps with make.
